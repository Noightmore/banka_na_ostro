# Concept of Operations Document for Simple Banking System

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe the concept of operations for the Simple Banking System (SBS). 
This document outlines the goals, objectives, and requirements for the system,
as well as its basic functionality and user interface. 
The SBS is a web-based system that allows users to access their account information and perform basic transactions,
such as making payments and checking their balance.

## System Overview

The SBS is a web-based application that allows users to access their banking information through a secure login process.
The system requires users to enter their account ID and password to access their account information. Once logged in,
the user will be presented with a dashboard that displays their account information,
including their account ID, name, and balance.


The system allows users to have multiple balances in their account, each of which represents a certain type of currency.
The balances contain information about the amount of the currency in the account.
Users can view their transaction history by clicking on the "History" button on the dashboard.
The history will display all incoming and outgoing payments,
including the account ID of the sender/receiver,
date (in UNIX timestamp format), currency type, and amount.

The SBS also provides a "Random Payment" feature, which allows users to
generate a random payment record to simulate a payment.

## System Requirements

The SBS must meet the following requirements:

- User authentication: users must be authenticated with their account ID and password before accessing their account information
- User verification: an email will be sent to the user's email address to verify the login, and the user must confirm the login before being granted access to their account
- Account information: users must be able to view their account information, including their account ID, name, and balance
- Multiple balances: users must be able to have multiple balances in their account, each representing a certain type of currency
- Transaction history: users must be able to view their transaction history, including all incoming and outgoing payments, the account ID of the sender/receiver, date, currency type, and amount
- Random payment generator: the system must provide a feature to generate a random payment record to simulate a real payment

## User Interface

The SBS user interface will be a web-based application accessible via a web browser.
The user interface will consist of the following components:

- Login screen: a screen where users will enter their account ID and password to access their account information
- Dashboard: a screen that displays the user's account information, including their account ID, name, and balance, as well as buttons to access the transaction history and generate a random payment

## Conclusion

The Simple Banking System (SBS) is a web-based application that provides users with access to their account information 
and basic transactional features. The system requires users to enter their account ID 
and password to access their account information, and users will receive an email to verify their login.
The SBS allows users to have multiple balances in their account, each representing a certain type of currency,
and provides a transaction history feature that displays all incoming and outgoing payments.
Additionally, the SBS provides a random payment generator for testing purposes.
